#Crop Yield prediction using Machine Learning and IoT

Crop Yield prediction using Machine Learning and IoT is our Final year B.Tech Project which helps the farmer to grow crops effectively in their crop fields. Most of the farmers in India are uneducated as a result of which they choose wrong crops to be grown on their field in wrong time.
