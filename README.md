# CROP YIELD PREDICTION USING MACHINE LEARNING AND IoT
#### Crop Yield prediction using Machine Learning and IoT is our Final year B.Tech Project which helps the farmer to grow crops effectively in their crop fields. Most of the farmers in India are uneducated as a result of which they choose wrong crops to be grown on their field in wrong time.

# DISCLAIMER ‚ö†Ô∏è
#### This is a PoC (Proof of concept) kind-of project. The data used here comes up with no guarantee from the creator. So, don't use it for making farming decisions. If you do so, the creator is not responsible for anything. However, this project presents the idea that how we can use ML/DL into precision farming if developed at large scale and with authentic and verified data.

# MOTIVATION üí™
#### *o Farming is one of the major sectors that influences a country‚Äôs economic growth.*

#### *o In country like India, majority of the population is dependent on agriculture for their livelihood. Many new technologies, such as Machine Learning and Deep Learning, are being implemented into agriculture so that it is easier for farmers to grow and maximize their yield.*

#### *o In this project, we have developed an Android App in which the Crop recommendation is displayed to the farmers based on the inputs from the IoT device. Along with this we also have kept the facility of Push Message which is triggered by using the Bluetooth of the IoT for those normal handsets.*
