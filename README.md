# Crop Yeild prediction using Machine Learning and IoT
Crop Yeild prediction using Machine Learning and IoT is our Final year B.Tech Project which helps the farmer to grow crops effectively in their crop feilds.Most of the farmers in India are uneducated as a result of which they choose wrong crops to be grown on their feild in wrong time.
#DISCLAIMER ⚠️
This is a POC(Proof of concept) kind-of project. The data used here comes up with no guarantee from the creator. So, don't use it for making farming decisions. If you do so, the creator is not responsible for anything. However, this project presents the idea that how we can use Machine Learning and IoT into Precision farming/Smart Farming, if developed at large scale and with authentic and verified data.
